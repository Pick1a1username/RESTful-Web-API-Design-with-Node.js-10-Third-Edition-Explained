This repository contains additional information for [the original repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/RESTful-Web-API-Design-with-Node.js-10-Third-Edition/tree/82686af8b4a37ec40138102ede084948f11ad131).

## Objectives

I'd like to add the following information:

* API Documentation in Each Chapter
  * So that you can easily track the status of your app.
* How to Test Your App with Docker
  * So that you can easily test your app.
  * This includes how to setup Mongo DB for test as well.

And moreover:

* Remove `.txt` from filenames.
* Include `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
  * Even though most of packages are installed globally, I'd like to install packages locally as much as possible.
